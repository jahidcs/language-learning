### Variable & Constants

Varible is always changable but we can declare constant value we can declare
For code readability er can declare this identifier as Uppercase like 'G = 9.8'
\*\*\* we can declare with lowercase but UPPERCASE is the good practice

### What is Identifier in Python?

- It's a name for variable, class, function etc
- We can use a/A to z/Z, 0-9 and underscore(\_)
- We can not use @, $, %, #, & etc for declare identifier
- Python is a case sensitive language(Python and python is different)

### Naming convention is the rules of naming of identifier

- For Global and local variable declaration use lowecase letter like gravity = 9.8
- Function name will be lowercase and devide by underscore like
  - def test_func():
    pass
- package and module name will be in lowercase like math, os, sys
- Class name will be start with upper case letter (capitalize)
  - class Car:
    pass
- if an identifier start and end with 2 underscore that means it is a language defined special name
  example: \_\_dict**, \_\_future**, \_\_all\_\_
- For Non public method we have to put 1 underscore
  - def \_protected():
    pass
- In the case of Private method we have to put 2 underscore
  - def \_\_private():
    pass
